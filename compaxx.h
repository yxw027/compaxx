/**
 * Returns current compass or magnetic heading, given 3-axis sensor
 * reading. Compass heading is heading read off the compass without
 * accounting for effects on the instrument of various metallic
 * objects in its surroundings. As such, this function requires that a
 * coarse calibration has been performed, so that we know compass
 * orientation relative to horizontal plane. It also requires at least
 * one fine calibration point, so that it can determine which way the
 * compass is pointing on a vessel or drone.
 *
 * Magnetic heading requires more fine calibration points (up to 36,
 * but at least 8 is recommended), and corrects the compass heading
 * for effects of environment on the instrument. It is therefore more
 * precise than a compass heading.
 *
 * @param cal Existing calibration structure. At least coarse
 *        calibration must have been performed.
